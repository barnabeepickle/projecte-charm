# ProjectE-Charms

An experimental ProjectE content addon for the 1.12.2 Cleanroom Mod Loader.

## Dependencies

 - [Cleanroom](https://github.com/CleanroomMC/Cleanroom) tested using `0.3.31-alpha` & `0.4.0-alpha`
 - [ProjectE](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/projecte) for 1.12.2
 - [Bubbles](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bubbles-a-baubles-fork) (an updated fork of [Baubles](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/baubles))

### Features

The following is a list of items added by this mod:

 - The `Transmutation Charm` functions like the base Transmutation Tablet but when equiped as a bauble gives you a keybind that opens the Transmutation GUI.
 - The `Trans-mutation Charm` the same as the normal charm but with a trans flag on the texture.
 - The `Trans-mutation Tablet` a Transmutation Tablet with a trans flag on the texture.
 - The `Trans-mutation Table` a Tranmutation Table with a trans flag on the top of it's texture.

### Why

I've been trying to get better at making Minecraft mods and had an idea while playing modded Minecraft a while ago for making an item that when equiped as a bauble would let you open the ProjectE Transmutation GUI, since I already had written some code for [Make Panorama](https://github.com/barnabeepickle/MakePanorama) I decided to make a small addon for ProjectE adding just that.

## Pull-Requests

If you want to help fix an issue improve the mod or more I am happy to merge pull requests.

When it comes to feature additions I will merge them if they align with want I want in this mod but if I don't and you still want the feature you could aways fork the mod remove all the already existing features and use the codebase to make a new ProjectE addon.
